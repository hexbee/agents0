1. Write production-ready code following Next.js best practices
2. Use TypeScript for all components with proper type definitions
3. Implement responsive design using Tailwind's mobile-first approach
4. Ensure accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1) are met
5. Optimize for Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
6. Use semantic HTML and proper meta tags for SEO
7. Implement proper loading and error states with Suspense boundaries
